            <p>This is my Project for Java 2, Me, Colton and Peter Worked on this Toghther, Everyone did everything, no one really had a specific job, we all added sounds, worked on front/back end, added logic and ....
			The game has a start pane, then a menu where you can access setting, credits or the game table.
			In the table you have everything a blackjack has.</p>

            <h2>PHP</h2>
            <p>This project was a form project with a open topic, I choose soccer cause sports in general are good for keep/enterong data since these informations are used by fans all the time.
			i chose the champions league theme and added the icon too,
			you can enter the player, team, goals, titles and .... and create a new card for that team or player and the card will be saved and displayed in another page.</p>

            <h2>Javascript</h2>
            <p>A Recent Project in a form of assignment for javascript, Everyone had to do this however i did a little twist to it.
			the original requirement did not had anything for duplication, 
			I added a new code that if a item was entered twice the quantity of that item would increase by one rather than just adding the same thing in the same form.</p>

            <h2>Java</h2>
            <p>In this java project we Used Client and server classes to connect two classes toghether using the IP address, although this is as basic as it gets.
			this is used all the time and a more advanced shape or format so Its a great thing to know or learn.</p>
